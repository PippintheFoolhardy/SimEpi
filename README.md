# SimEpi

##  Repository for Introduction to Simulation in Epidemiology

This repository contains scripts for EPID: 6410 - Intro to Simulation in Epidemiology (Spring, 2021). This repository will be continuously updated throughout the spring semester as the course progresses. It is recommended that you keep a current copy of this repository on you local machine by forking (preferable) or cloning and regularly refreshing the code. Note: you may also download files manually. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) for instructions on how to "fork" a repository.

This repository is organized into the following structure:

* **admin** - contains administrative scrips (e.g., packages to install)
* **in_class_scripts** - contains example scripts that get generated during in-class lectures/labs
* **functions** - contains scripts for R functions we develop in class or for assignments
* **assignments** - contains starter scripts and instructions for weekly assignments
* **assignment_solutions** - contains example solutions for the weekly assignments
* **projects** - contain scripts and instructions for the course projects

Note: additional folders may be added to this list as the course progresses.

### Recommendations for workflow 

It is recommended that you fork this repository and work from within your own copy of this repo. This will allow your own code to easily access and refer to the path of the various scripts and functions we create in class.  To do so, you should create additional folders to store your own work at the base of this repository; **DO NOT edit (create or add content) to the main folders in this Repo, this will create problems when you try to keep your fork synched.** You should regularly synch your forked copy of the repo as course content is added or modified.

You should create an R project around you local copy of the repo. You may want to store the R project in the base of the repository folder; if so, consider adding this path to your .gitignore file.
